# pry-try

Open a pry-session with the gems you want to try.  

## Usage

This gem should supports the following usecases:

### pipe-in a script

```bash
# piped-in content is evaluated in a new pry-session:
$ echo '@a = 1' | pry-try
[1] pry(main)> @a =1
1
[2] pry(main)> 

# handy to share scripts with others:
$ curl <path-to-raw-gist> | pry-try
```

### try a gem

Start a new pry-session with the requested gems loaded:

```bash
$ pry-try activesupport
